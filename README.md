# SimpleSynapse

[Synapse](https://www.synapse.org/) is an open source software platform for researchers to coordinate projects and freely store their data. SimpleSynapse is Python API that allows data scientists to organize and sync data.

Acknowledgements and thanks extend to Sage Bionetworks for developing the Synapse Python client, for which without SimpleSynapse would be much less simple.
